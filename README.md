⚕️I have a background as a physical therapist and I am beginning to venture into the world of development with the intention of linking the development of assistance applications for rehab therapy to my clinical practice, but I do not rule out participating in other projects designing or programming immersive environments for different solutions. 

👥 Above all, I am interested in participating in projects that have a social meaning. I think that technology should improve people's quality of life.

🗒️ I invite you to read my blog 👉 https://fisiobionics.medium.com

Looking for meeting points between physical rehabilitation and technological development. Currently, I am studying the last year of my Physiotherapy degree and simultaneously I am completing a Diploma in Bionic Technology at P4H Bionics. My interest in assistive technology and its applications in physical rehabilitation has led me to explore ways to integrate it into my practice. In the medium term, I want to embark on research and development of this type of products.
