🌱I´m currently learning XR Development. I'm delving into programming with C#, C++, Unity, Unreal and Python.

⚕️I have a background as a physical therapist and I am beginning to venture into the world of development with the intention of linking the development of assistance applications for rehab therapy to my clinical practice, but I do not rule out participating in other projects designing or programming immersive environments for different solutions. 

👥 Above all, I am interested in participating in projects that have a social meaning. I think that technology should improve people's quality of life.

🗒️ I invite you to read my blog 👉 https://fisiobionics.medium.com
